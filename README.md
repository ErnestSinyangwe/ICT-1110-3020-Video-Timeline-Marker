.............................................................................................
YouTube has become an increasingly popular platform for sharing video content. Instructors,
such as those responsible for ICT 1110 and ICT 3020 will routinely share videos of live lectures
via YouTube. However, a common complaint from students in the relative length of the videos.
YouTube has a timeline feature that enables key points in the video to be marked.
This project is about developing an application that will enable students to crowdsource
important time frames in a given lecture recording.
● Basic guidelines
○ Application that will enable users to mark timelines
○ Application to be able to render videos from YouTube via YouTube Data API
● Additional skills required
